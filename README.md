# Leelol & Twitch

Leelol is designed to work as an unofficial API for League of Legends due to the lack of a public official one. 
Our source data is the [League of Legends  Wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Base_champion_statistics) and [Mobafire](http://mobafire.com/league-of-legends/).

# Status

Currently, the application is not finished and it will not work as it intended to. You can just use the web interface to play with the champions and some stats and items.
